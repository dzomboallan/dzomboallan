1. **[Employee Payroll](https://github.com/dzomboallan/employee_payroll)**
## Description:
This system is a combination of a web as well as an android application where the user will be using the Android application and admin as well as HR will work with the web application. This system is meant for fieldwork users. The user will have this application on their Android devices(phone), when the user logs in to the system his/her image will be captured and their GPS location will be sent to the admin where the admin will view the image and GPS location in the web application. After Login, the GPS location of the employee will be tracked automatically by the system and sent to the admin after every 5 minutes. When the user logs out of the system again their image will be captured as well as GPS location will be sent to the admin. This is to keep track of the attendance as well as payroll of the fieldwork people, this system plays a major role. The role of the admin is to add new employees by entering their details and the admin will provide the employee with an identity number and password to the user so that they can access the application on his Android phone. Admin can view the GPS location of the employee by entering Employee Identity Number as well as Date. Admin can check the salary of the particular employee by entering the date and employee ID. Admin can view the latitude and longitude of the GPS location sent by the employee. Admin can change the password of the employee. When the HR login to the system he can check the GPS location of the employee by entering employee ID and date. HR can check the salary of a particular employee by entering the employee's identity number and date. This application helps admin and HR to easily check the salary of the employee. Since the GPS location of the employee is tracked, so employee will not attempt to add proxy attendance.
